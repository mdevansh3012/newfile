Hey Sunshine,

if've you have arrived here then I guess this is it ,

I’ve always wondered what it would be like to have someone by my side when life’s chaos feels too much—someone who brings peace amid all that noise. Never in my wildest dreams did I think that kind of peace could come from a person. But it’s you, Yashvi Shah. You’re the calm to my chaos, the stars in my sky, the dream I never want to wake up from.

I know I’ve made mistakes along the way, but I promise I’ve never done anything to hurt you on purpose. And I know I’m rambling now, but here’s what I’m trying to say: I love you, Yashvi Pookie Shah. I’m completely, honestly, and madly in love with you. So if there’s any part of you that feels the same way… then let’s make it real. ❤
